                Since Nov 28, 2023 I decided to start a new project, a 2d game made purely in C++ with a use of SMFL 
                library so I would not have to deal with windows API manually but in a effectibe, intuitive and reliable way.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have made it mainly to challange myself and to develop my C++ skills as I always wanted to do something like this
                but one day I said enough is enough and simply started.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game itself is far from being finished or even playable as I am new to game development and whole concept
                of it is something completly new and only once I started I realized how much I have to actually write code in 
                order to get something done.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game itself will be dynamic shooter in 2d a bit like doom but faster, more difficult with a focus on aim. There
                will be also stuff like power-ups that for example would make whole game in slow-mo or make you invincible also with
                inventory and 5 types of weapons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whole project can be seen on my <a href="https://github.com/MrVaxiZ/HandsWarmer">GitHub</a> as for today (30.01.2024)
                there is not much to be seen currently I have only basic shooting mechanic, jumping, collision and very basic enemy ai.

                    For around 5 weeks I have been developing Dating-App that is very similiar to Tinder or other apps like this but there is one key
                    diffrence which is collage limit only.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    This bacicly means that the app will show people only from their collage just like facebook at the begginings. It will
                    work in a way that user have to provide his/her collage email. In my case as a PJATK student it would be "SXXXXX@pjwstk.edu.pl" 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You could realize that I am using future form even tho I am developing this app for 5 weeks now. It's not without a reason. 
                    I was focusing on working skeleton which is database, API and ofcoruse Client side things which I mentioned is last part of developing
                    this app and it will be added at the ending as it is easy however few days ago I encounter a obsticle on may way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to change a database from SQlite to PostgreSql as I could not stand annoying bugs from SQlite while creating new migrations
                    when I was doing that I decided to also publish app like it is to couple of friends just so they could test it's functionality. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I already had bought hosting for it but while doing that I did not saw that my current plan does not support .net api or docker so it's
                    impossible to develop this app on that hosting and to publish that I would have to rent VPS which I will do but this is the obsticle
                    that currently stopped me from developing this app. However you can check it in current status on my <a href="https://github.com/MrVaxiZ/Dating-App/tree/main/DA" style="color: rgb(36, 101, 163);">GitHub</a>
    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course I could still develop this app on diffrent platform like azure right? I don't know how other platforms but I 
                    tried azure and there is a problem with PostgreSql server as azure does not allow to set up free server or at least in 
                    resionable prices and this app cannot work without database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So all is left would be to develop this app offline and yes it is possible of course and I will still be doing that.
                    I thought that it would be just a good idea to share the issue I encounter lately :)
